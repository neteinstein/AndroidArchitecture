Android Academy Code Samples

Architecture Skeleton: Contains a sample of what could be a scalable Android Architecture containing:
 - Application Singleton
 - Activities
 - Fragments
 - Services
 - Managers to handle the business logic 
 - Utils
 
And is developed following a near dependecy injection code-base (without using any library just enforcing code standards).

Good code policies regarding module independence are followed with the use of Service Provider Pattern, Interfaces, and a few more things.

Give a look. 


Ps: I've left a couple of libraries already ready to go, which I recommend.
